# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS

# Aim: 
To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios.  Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses 

### AI Tools Required: Chatgpt 

# Explanation: 
## 1. Introduction

Industries rely on maintenance reports to track equipment health, identify failures, and plan preventive actions. Traditionally, these reports are written manually by engineers or technicians, which is time-intensive, inconsistent, and sometimes inaccurate.

With Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we can automate this process by combining prompt templating techniques with the Command Pattern from software engineering.

This study examines:

How prompt templates can standardize report structures.

How the Command Pattern ensures modularity and scalability in automating report generation.

A proposed system that integrates both to deliver accurate and consistent maintenance reports.

## 2. Prompt Templating Techniques
### 2.1 Concept

A prompt template is a predefined textual structure used to instruct an AI model. Templates allow dynamic insertion of contextual data while preserving a consistent style and structure.

### 2.2 Types of Prompt Templates

####  Static Templates
- **Definition:** Fixed wording, minimal customization.  
- **Example:** “Generate a maintenance report.”
- **Use Case:** Quick summaries.

####  Parameterized Templates
- **Definition:** Use placeholders for variables.  
- **Example:** Equipment: {equipment_name} (ID: {equipment_id})  , Fault Detected: {fault_description} , Date: {detection_date}  
- **Use Case:** Regular machine-specific reports.

####  Conditional Templates
- **Definition:** Logic-based filling depending on fault severity or type.  
- **Example:** {if severity == "High"} Generate a detailed analysis with safety warnings.  {else} Provide a brief fault summary.
####  Chained Templates (Hierarchical)
- **Definition:** Templates that call sub-templates.  
- **Example:** A high-level report calls sub-templates for:
- Root Cause Analysis
- Downtime Estimation
- Maintenance Actions

## 3. Command Pattern Technique

### 3.1 Overview
The **Command Pattern** encapsulates a request as an object, enabling decoupling between:
- **Invoker** → who requests the report
- **Receiver** → AI model generating it

### 3.2 Components in this System
- **Command Interface** → Defines the operation `execute()`.
- **Concrete Command** (e.g., `GenerateMaintenanceReport`) → Implements `execute()` using a prompt template.
- **Invoker** → Maintenance Manager System / Dashboard that issues commands.
- **Receiver** → LLM/AI Model that processes prompts and generates reports.
- **Client** → Configures commands with templates and data.

### 3.3 Workflow
1. Maintenance manager (**Invoker**) requests a report.  
2. The system selects the appropriate template.  
3. A **Command object** is created and filled with real-time machine data.  
4. Command calls the **LLM (Receiver)** with the generated prompt.  
5. The AI produces a detailed maintenance report.

## 4. Integration of Prompt Templating with Command Pattern

### 4.1 Architecture Flow
- **Data Layer** → Collects sensor data, logs, fault alerts, etc.  
- **Template Layer** → Library of predefined prompt templates (static, parameterized, conditional).  
- **Command Layer** → Encapsulates requests using commands like `GenerateMaintenanceReport`, `GenerateFailureAnalysisReport`.  
- **Invoker Layer** → Interfaces (web app, dashboard, or API) that trigger report generation.  
- **Receiver (AI Model)** → Processes filled templates and generates structured natural language reports.  
- **Output Layer** → Stores or exports reports in PDF/Excel/Database.
### 4.2 Example Implementation (Python)
```python
# Command Interface
class Command:
  def execute(self):
      raise NotImplementedError

# Concrete Command
class GenerateMaintenanceReport(Command):
  def __init__(self, template, data, llm):
      self.template = template
      self.data = data
      self.llm = llm

  def execute(self):
      # Fill template with real-time data
      filled_prompt = self.template.format(**self.data)
      return self.llm.generate(filled_prompt)

# Receiver (Simulated AI Model)
class LLMModel:
  def generate(self, prompt):
      # Mock AI response for illustration
      return f"[Generated Report]\n{prompt}\nRoot Cause: Bearing wear.\nAction: Replace spindle bearing."

# Example Usage
template = """
Generate a maintenance report for {equipment_name} (ID: {equipment_id}).
Fault: {fault_description}.
Date: {detection_date}.
"""

data = {
  "equipment_name": "CNC Lathe",
  "equipment_id": "MCH-102",
  "fault_description": "Spindle overheating",
  "detection_date": "2025-09-04"
}

llm = LLMModel()
command = GenerateMaintenanceReport(template, data, llm)
report = command.execute()
print(report)
```
